The rules of this game are super simple: find a way to enable all toggles on screen.

Sounds easy? The trick is, each toggle will mess up with the state of other toggles... find the right combination to get to the next level!

Can you beat all levels? It gets harder and harder...

Some toggles will switch their neighbors, others will switch everything... and you only have so many moves to get it right!
